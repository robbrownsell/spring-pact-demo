# Spring Pact Demo

This service provides a simple example of a Pact provider. The project relies on a pact broker 
with pacts from consumers from the following projects:

[git@github.com:robbrownsell/pact-consumer-test.git]()

[git@github.com:robbrownsell/pact-js.git]() 
 
Once published, the pacts can be verified by running the tests in this project.
